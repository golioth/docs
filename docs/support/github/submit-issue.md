We use GitHub issues to track user problems and feature requests. Please be descriptive in your issues and follow best practices. [Here is a guide that we like for GitHub issues](https://blog.zenhub.com/best-practices-for-github-issues/), though there are many other guides on the web that will show how to properly report an issue.

## Beta user accessible repositories

Beta users can read and create issues against the following repositories:
- [Golioth Zephyr](https://github.com/golioth/zephyr)
- [Golioth Docs](https://github.com/golioth/docs)
- [Golioth code samples](https://github.com/golioth/samples)
- [Golioth homebrew tap](https://github.com/golioth/homebrew-tap)
- [Golioth community feature requests](https://github.com/golioth/community)

## Troubleshooting

If you are an approved member of the beta access program, but don't have access to the above repositories, please email beta@golioth.io.
