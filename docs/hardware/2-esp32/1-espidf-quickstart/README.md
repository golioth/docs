:::caution
You must first follow the [Golioth Platform Quickstart](/getting-started/) before attempting this guide.
:::

This walk-through will demonstrate how to quickly connect an Espressif [ESP32 DevKitC](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/hw-reference/esp32/get-started-devkitc.html) using [the Espressif IoT Development Framework (ESP-IDF)](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/).

:::note

[Golioth's ESP-IDF SDK](https://github.com/golioth/golioth-esp-idf-sdk) will work with other ESP32 devkits. We're using the DevKitC as a reference board to provide a consistent getting started experience.
