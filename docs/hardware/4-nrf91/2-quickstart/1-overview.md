This walk-through will demonstrate how to quickly connect an nRF9160 based device to Golioth. The [Nordic nRF9160 DK](/hardware/catalog/boards/quickstart/arm_nrf9160dk_nrf9160) is officially supported by the Golioth SDK and will be used in this demonstration.

See the [Hardware Catalog](/hardware/catalog/search) search tool for more devices that use the nRF9160.
