title: Read and Write LightDB Data
---

Devices interact with LightDB using the gateways available on the platform. For now, only CoAP is available.

> See [CoAP Gateway Interface](/reference/protocols/coap/lightdb) or [MQTT Gateway Interface](/reference/protocols/mqtt/lightdb)

# Example

Let's imagine that we are monitoring environment data using an IoT device. All of the data for our device is going to be saved on LightDB.

### Writing/Updating data with POST/PUT

We can start by saving temperature data on LightDB. On requests to write data, the body can be a JSON/CBOR object or a single value in the following formats:

- `boolean`
- `float`
- `integer`
- `string`

Here is a snippet of example code to save a temperature value of 30 CÂº at path `/env/temp`

```
$ coap --path /.d/env/temp -m PUT --psk-id deadbeef-id --psk supersecret --host coap.golioth.io -b "{\"value\": 30.0, \"unit\" : \"c\" }" --format json
```

After the above request and device data saves in LightDB, it will look like this:

```
{
  "env": {
    "temp": {
      "value" : 30.0,
      "unit" : "c"
    }
  }
}
```

You can set any data on any path, which allows flexibility throughout the lifetime of the device and connection. Perhaps during initialization we send both temperatur and unit type, but afterwards we only send the temperature value to the specific path. A long as another unit is not written, the first value will persist.

```
$ coap --path /.d/env/temp/value -m PUT --psk-id deadbeef-id --psk supersecret --host coap.golioth.io -b "35.0" --format json
```

After this commend, the device state will look like this:

```
{
  "env": {
    "temp": {
      "value" : 35.0,
      "unit" : "c"
    }
  }
}
```

You can also write data using our APIs and `goliothctl`. Taking the enviroment sensing use case, let's say that we want to set a given alert threshold on the device. We can do this way:

```
$ goliothctl lightdb set [device name] /config/temp -b "{\"min\": 20.0, \"max\": 40.0 }"
```

:::note
`[device name]` should be replace by your device name and wrapped in quotes if spaces are used.
:::

This way the device can also read the `/config` path and calculate alerts. If an alert condition is met, it can post data to `/alert`.

```
$ coap --path /.d/ -m PUT --psk-id deadbeef-id --psk supersecret --host coap.golioth.io -b "{ \"alert\" : { \"temp\": true }, \"env\" : { \"temp\" : { \"value\" : 45.0 } } }" --format json
```

The current device state might look like this:

```
{
  "env": {
    "temp": {
      "value" : 45.0,
      "unit" : "c"
    }
  },
  "alert": {
    "temp": true
  },
  "config": {
    "temp": {
      "min": 20.0,
      "max": 40.0
    }
  }
}
```

### Reading data with GET

The return value of the CoAP API depends on what is stored on LightDB, which can be any JSON like data type like mentioned [on this guide](./structure-data). The value will be encoded depending on the `accept` header that is set on the request.

So to read the device data, we can issue a GET request like this:

```
$ coap --path /.d/env -m GET --psk-id deadbeef-id --psk supersecret --host coap.golioth.io --accept json
```

And that will return the data like on the previous step:

```
{
  "temp": {
    "value" : 45.0,
    "unit" : "c"
  }
}
```

But you can also request a more specific path, like this:

```
$ coap --path /.d/env/temp/value -m GET --psk-id deadbeef-id --psk supersecret --host coap.golioth.io --accept json
```

And in this case, will return just `45.0`.

### Deleting data with DELETE method

To remove data, we can send a `DELETE` request with the path that needs to be cleaned. On our example, let's say that the device has a button to acknowledge the alert state and clean the `/alert/temp` value.

```
$ coap --path /.d/alert/temp -m DELETE --psk-id deadbeef-id --psk supersecret --host coap.golioth.io
```

Also, you can do that same acknowledgement via our APIs or `goliothctl`. Maybe for example, there is a web application that the final user can acknowledge that alert. Using `goliothctl` you can delete the path with this command:

```
$ goliothctl lightdb delete [device name] /alert/temp
```

The final state of the device in this scenario would be like this:

```
{
  "env:" {
    "temp": {
      "value" : 45.0,
      "unit" : "c"
    }
  },
  "alert": {},
  "config": {
    "temp": {
      "min": 20.0,
      "max": 40.0
    }
  }
}
```
