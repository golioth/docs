title: Wi-Fi & Ethernet
---

Wi-Fi (wireless) and Ethernet (wired) are data link layer protocols that are
typically used in local area networks (LAN) or as part of a wide area network
(WAN). For this reason, devices that connect to Golioth over Wi-Fi or Ethernet
typically are either stationary, or use Wi-Fi or Ethernet alongside other
protocols (e.g. [cellular](/connectivity/protocols/cellular)).

Golioth does not offer a managed connectivity option for devices leveraging
Wi-Fi or Ethernet, so customers are responsible for managing network
configuration, including obtaining and storing any required credentials.

If interested in a managed connectivity option for Wi-Fi or Ethernet, please
reach out to [sales@golioth.io](mailto:sales@golioth.io).
