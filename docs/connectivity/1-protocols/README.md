title: Protocols
---

Golioth supports devices that communicate via a wide array of connectivity
protocols, including [cellular](/connectivity/protocols/cellular), [Wi-Fi &
Ethernet](/connectivity/protocols/wifi-ethernet), and [Bluetooth Low Energy
(Bluetooth LE)](/connectivity/protocols/bluetooth). Other protocols, such as
[Thread](https://www.threadgroup.org/) or
[LoRa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa), may be used to connect to the
Golioth platform, but will typically require custom infrastructure and
configuration.

Supported protocols can be broadly categorized into those that connect directly
to the Golioth platform, and those that connect indirectly. Indirectly connected
devices, such as those using Bluetooth LE, typically depend on one or more
[gateway](/connectivity/networks/gateways) devices that directly connect to the
Golioth platform and provide a connectivity bridge.
