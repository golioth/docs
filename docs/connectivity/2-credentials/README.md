Golioth requires that all devices that connect with the platform are able to
transmit and receive data in a secure manner. In order to support a wide range
of products and manufacturing workflows, Golioth integrates with
customer-managed [Public Key Infrastructure
(PKI)](/connectivity/credentials/pki).

For demonstration purposes, [Pre-Shared Keys
(PSKs)](/connectivity/credentials/psk) are supported. PSKs are not recommended
in a production setting.
