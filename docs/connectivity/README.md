Golioth Connectivity encompasses all protocol, infrastructure, and credential
configuration required for a device to connect to the Golioth platform and
utilize device management, data streaming, and application services.

Customers may choose to perform protocol-specific configuration themselves, or
defer management to Golioth Connectivity. The latter strategy is referred to as
_managed connectivity_, and allows customers to obtain more advanced insights
into end-to-end communication, making it easier to manage a fleet and
troubleshoot connectivity issues. Golioth Connectivity currently offers managed
connectivity support for [cellular](/connectivity/protocols/cellular) and
[Bluetooth Low Energy](/connectivity/protocols/bluetooth) devices.
