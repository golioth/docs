Log messages are delivered to the Golioth Logs service via
[Pipelines](/data-routing). By default, any new Projects created on the Golioth
platform will have a [CBOR logs
Pipeline](/data-routing/examples/golioth-logs-cbor) configured automatically
that will deliver data to Golioth Logs.

See the [Golioth Logs data destination](/data-routing/destinations/logs) for
more information.
