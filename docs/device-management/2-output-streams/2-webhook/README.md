Webhooks are a simple and flexible way to receive events from the Golioth platform using HTTP. It is really easy to build a web server to receive these events and you can write you own logic to process them.

### Webhook Specific Attributes

For each Output Stream type, there is a set of specify attributes. Here are the ones for Webhooks:

| Attribute | Type   | Required | Description                                         |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| uri       | string | âœ…       | URI where events are sent via POST request          |
| headers   | object |          | Extra HTTP headers to send                          |

### Example

As mentioned on [Output Streams Overview](/device-management/output-streams), events are sent using the [Cloud Events](https://cloudevents.io) format. For Webhooks specifically, some metadata of the event are sent as HTTP headers.

Here is an example of an event arriving on a webhook. Headers prefixed with `Ce-` are related to Cloud Events and the message body is the event payload (see event payloads on [Output Streams Event Types](/device-management/output-streams/event-types/events)).

```
