Device Management encompasses all of the services that allow you to control your
IoT fleet while it is in the field.

* Control how OTA firmware updates are rolled out
* Gather useful troubleshooting information using remote logging
* Adjust how devices are functioning using the settings service
* Issue device-specific commands using remote procedure calls

Get familiar with Device Management via the Golioth web console. Then go beyond,
using our REST API which provides access to everything available on the web
console, plus additional functionality.
