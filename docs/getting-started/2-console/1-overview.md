The Golioth Console provides a web-based configuration tool for managing your devices. In this section we will walk through the provisioning process for a device. However, for a wholistic understanding it's good to know that the console is a powerful tool you can use to:

* Create and manage projects
* Provision your fleet of hardware, organized by projects and tags
* View and query device logs and LightDB streams
* View and change persistent data in LightDB
* Manage Over-the-Air (OTA) updates for firmware and other assets
* Manage API keys (REST, WebSockets, etc.)

While everything you do in the Console can also be accomplished via [the Golioth Command Line Tools](../commandline), we recommend beginning with the console.
