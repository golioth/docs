To begin using Golioth please register for an account at [console.golioth.io](https://console.golioth.io/).

Once registered, you will be greeted with a Wizard to guide you in provisioning your first device.

### Step 1

* Enter a Project Name of your choosing

### Step 2

* Enter a human-readable Device Name
* Under Credential Info, the Identity of this device will automatically be populated from the device name with `-id` appended
* Enter a Pre-Shared Key (PSK). This is a password that will authenticate this device to the Golioth Cloud

It really is that simple, you have provisioned your first device! Let's provision a second device to get to know the console just a bit better.
