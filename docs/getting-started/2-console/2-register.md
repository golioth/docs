To begin using Golioth please register for an account at [console.golioth.io](https://console.golioth.io/).

Once registered, you can review our terms of service and continue to the Wizard that guides you through provisioning your first device.

### Step 1: Project name

* Enter a Project Name of your choosing

### Step 2: Device name

* Enter a human-readable Device Name

### Step 3: Device credentials

* The Identity of this device is automatically populated from the device name with `-id` and `@project-name` appended
* A Pre-Shared Key (PSK) is automatically generated. This is a password that will authenticate this device to the Golioth Cloud

It really is that simple, you have provisioned your first device! Let's provision a second device to get to know the console just a bit better.
