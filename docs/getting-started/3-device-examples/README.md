# Run Example Code on Your Hardware

Golioth works on literally hundreds of devices.

If your target microcontroller can run Zephyr, ESP-IDF, or ModusToolbox&trade;,
it will work well with Golioth. Even if you need a device that doesn't work on
any of these platforms, we have [an SDK porting
guide](https://github.com/golioth/golioth-firmware-sdk/blob/main/docs/Porting_Guide.md)
you can use to add support.

However, we know you want to take Golioth for a test-drive right now. And that's
no problem. We recommend you try out some of our sample code. There are two
options for this, you can run a pre-compiled binary to add a device to your
Golioth fleet, or compile one of the many sample applications in our device
SDKs.
