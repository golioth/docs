What is NCS?


[nRF Connect SDK
(NCS)](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-software/nRF-Connect-SDK)
is a software development kit developed and maintained by Nordic Semiconductor
for use with their devices. NCS is a fork of Zephyr RTOS that includes custom
libraries and binary assest necessary for using Nordic proprietary features like
Cellular and Bluetooth Low Energy.

The Golioth Firmware SDK can be included in your NCS projects as a Zephyr
module.

## Using NCS with Golioth

Golioth can be added to the manifest of any NCS project. This section shows how
