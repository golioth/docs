title: ESP-IDF with Golioth
---

## What is ESP-IDF?

The Espressif IoT Development Framework
([ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/)) is a
FreeRTOS-based platform developed and maintained by [Espressif
Systems](https://espressif.com/) for their line of ESP32 microcontrollers. The
Golioth Firmware SDK can be included in your projects as an ESP-IDF component.

## Using ESP32 with Golioth

The ESP32 is a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth combination chip. There are multiple versions
of the chip, including the ESP32, ESP32-S2, and ESP32-S3 based on the Xtensa
core and the ESP32-C3 which uses the RISC-V core.

Golioth works with all ESP32 variants supported by the ESP-IDF platform. This
section shows how to set up your build environment, compile, and run demo code
that connects to Golioth.
