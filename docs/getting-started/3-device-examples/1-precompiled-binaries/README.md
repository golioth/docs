description: Try Golioth without needing to compile

Golioth currently offers pre-compiled binaries for three different devices:

* Nordic Thingy:91
* Nordic nRF9160 DK
* Nordic nRF7002 DK

:::tip There are many other options

If you do not have one of these devices available, you can still run Golioth
example code by compiling it yourself. Please see the [Compiling Example
Code](/getting-started/device-examples/compile-example-code) section of the
Getting Started guide.
