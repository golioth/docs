description: Try Golioth without needing to compile
---

The quickest way to try out Golioth is by using one of the test applications
that we offer. These include firmware binaries that are ready to flash to your
hardware. Once completed, you will be able to assign your own device credentials
to get connected.

These test apps send and receive data, listen for fleetwide settings,
demonstrate remote procedure calls (RPC), and more. We'll walk you through it
all so that you get a solid hands-on experience.

Golioth currently offers pre-compiled binaries for three different devices:

* Nordic Thingy:91
* Nordic nRF9160 DK
* Nordic nRF7002 DK

:::tip There are many other options

If you do not have one of these devices available, you can still run Golioth
example code by compiling it yourself. Please see the [Compiling Example
Code](/getting-started/device-examples/compile-example-code) section of the
Getting Started guide.
