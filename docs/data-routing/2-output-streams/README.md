title: Output Streams Overview
---

Output Streams are a feature of the Golioth platform that allow users to
integrate their device data seamlessly with a number of external services. Data
sent to [LightDB Stream](/data-routing/application-services/lightdb-stream) can
be forwarded to an external service by setting up an Output Stream for the
service in the relevant Golioth project.
