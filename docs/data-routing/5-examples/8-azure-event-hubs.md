[Azure Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/event-hubs) is a cloud
native data streaming service that can stream millions of events per second,
with low latency, from any source to any destination. The [Azure Event Hubs data
destination](/data-routing/destinations/azure-event-hubs) on Golioth accepts
data in any format and delivers it the specified `topic`.

> Azure Event Hubs supports event hubs and topics. Either may be used in the
> `topic` parameter for this example.

This example omits a `content_type` filter and accepts any data payload on any
path, then delivers it to Azure Event Hubs.

:::info Reminder
Make sure to create a [secret](/data-routing/secrets) named
`AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING` that includes a valid [Azure Event Hubs connection
string](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/event-hubs/event-hubs-get-connection-string).
