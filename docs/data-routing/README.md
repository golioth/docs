## Overview

Data Routing is how you can get data from your IoT fleet to where you need it.

While you can use the Golioth web console to view, search, and sort the data
coming into your devices, most customers also need to connect their data to
existing databases, business logic, or user apps. Golioth is built for this!

## Application Services

Our application services detail how to work with stateful (LightDB State) and
time-series (LightDB Stream) fleet data. These pages focus on using the
`goliothctl` and `coap` [command-line
tools](/reference/command-line-tools/tutorial/). You will likely find this
section useful during active development.

## Output Streams

Output Streams are integrations with popular services like cloud servers,
database platforms, and visualization engines. These pages include detailed
guides on how to connect your Golioth accounts to these services so that incoming
device data immediately passes through Golioth and arrives where you need it.
