This is a guide to implementing firmware updates for embedded devices using the Golioth Device Firmware Update (DFU) service. It is recommended but not necessary to become familiar with the individual components involved in the service which are described in the DFU background document in detail. Working through the Getting Started Guide is also a prerequisite to ensure that the necessary tooling is place to build and implement this solution.

The steps to implementation are as follows:
* Create a device with credentials in the Golioth console
* Build and flash MCUBoot for the target board
  * If building firmware using the Nordic SDK, this step is integrated into the application build
  * If building firmware using stock Zephyr and/or custom targets, this step will be done separately.
* Build and flash the application utilizing the DFU API applying the device credentials created earlier to the appropriate 
* Build (but don't flash) the application specifying an alternative firmware image version from the previous. 
* Upload the alternative image version to Golioth Console and prepare it for release
* The active application running the DFU service will automatically download the release candidate and update the firmware.

## Get Device Credentials

The first requirement of the service is creating device credentials. This procedure is available in the Getting Started Guide. The goliothctl command line tool interacts with the golioth console to create a virtual device.  Virtual device credentials in this sample are applied to the embedded device via the proj.conf file.  This credential configuration method is common to all Golioth service reference code.

The next steps will vary slightly based on the target hardware. The final command line arguement in the build commands is the directory in which the sample project lives.  This specification will depend upon where the command was executed from in the terminal.  The project is located in <ProjectRoot\>/modules/lib/golioth/samples/dfu.  Golioth has tested the following three targets:

<TabItem value="nrf9160-feather">
Build the sample application:

```west build -b circuitdojo_feather_nrf9160_ns samples/dfu```

See mcumgr guide for mcumgr installation.
Enter bootloader and use mcumgr to flash firmware:

```mcumgr --conntype serial --connstring /dev/ttyUSB,baudrate=1000000 build/zephyr/app_update.bin```

Next the application will be built a second time. The parameter -DCONFIG_MCUBOOT_IMAGE_VERSION will be used to alter the version number assigned to the firmware and will ultimately serve to trigger a firmware download.

```west build -p -b circuitdojo_feather_nrf9160_ns samples/dfu -- -DCONFIG_MCUBOOT_IMAGE_VERSION=\"1.2.3\"```

Follow Over-The-Air (OTA) Updates guide using goliothctl to turn the update binary generated by the previous command into an artifact which can be consumed by the Golioth Cloud.  The binary can be found at build/zephyr/app_update.bin. Complete that guide to activate a release campaign featuring the update firmware.

Terminal output is viewable over UART at 115200 baud. After the device establishes an active connection with the Golioth Cloud, it will begin a firmware update download if the version of the firmware release candidate is different from that currently flashed to the device.

<TabItem value="nrf9160-dk">
Build the sample application:

```west build -b nrf9160dk_nrf9160_ns samples/dfu```

Flash the firmware with the following command:

```west flash```

Next the application will be built a second time. The parameter -DCONFIG_MCUBOOT_IMAGE_VERSION will be used to alter the version number assigned to the firmware and will ultimately serve to trigger a firmware download.

## Signing and flashing the signed image

In the mean time use the dfu [sample readme](https://github.com/golioth/zephyr-sdk/tree/main/samples/dfu) for guidance on image signing.


## Watch the device update

If the procedure has been followed to create the release candidate and the 'old' firmware is currently running on the target board, then the DFU process should be started in Zephyr. This is what should be visible on serial console:

```
At this point mcuboot swaps the first application slot (containing old firmware) with the second application slot (containing new firmware). After few seconds (or a minute depending on firmware size) new firmware will be booted from first application slot and following messages should appear on serial console:

```

```
The application creates a shell command accessible via the serial console.  Execute the command:
```mcuboot```
to confirm that new firmware is running from primary area (first application slot):

```
