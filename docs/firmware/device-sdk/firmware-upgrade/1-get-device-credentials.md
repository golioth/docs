The first requirement of the service is creating device credentials. This procedure is available in [Authorizing Devices](/getting-started/2-commandline/6-authorize-devices.md) section of the Getting Started Guide. The `goliothctl` command line tool interacts with the Golioth console to create a virtual device.  Virtual device credentials in this sample are applied to the embedded device via the proj.conf file.  This credential configuration method is common to all Golioth service reference code.
