If you have already worked through the [Getting Started Guide](/getting-started/1-overview.md) to create device credentials, there is more information regarding device authentication available in the [Authorizing Devices](/getting-started/3-commandline/6-authorize-devices.md) section.  After credentials are entered into the configuration file, there is no further direct interaction with the credentials.  Credentials will be handled by the Golioth System Client in the background.
