LightDB is a database service hosted by Golioth. It can be used to create applications involving resource state. Device state such as LED on/off, door lock position, or thermostat settings could be uploaded and or managed from the Golioth cloud. The key differentiator between the LightDB and LightDB Stream services offered by Golioth is data persistence. LightDB data values do not accumulate. They are replaced with update calls. The LightDB Stream service can be used to create time series data.
