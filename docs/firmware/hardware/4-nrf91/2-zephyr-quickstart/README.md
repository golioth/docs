:::caution
You must first follow the [Golioth Platform Quickstart](/getting-started) before attempting this guide.
:::

This walk-through will demonstrate how to quickly connect an nRF9160 based device to Golioth. The [Nordic nRF9160 DK](https://www.nordicsemi.com/Products/Development-hardware/nRF9160-DK) is officially supported by the Golioth SDK and will be used in this demonstration.

See the [Hardware Catalog](/hardware/catalog/search) search tool for more devices that use the nRF9160.
