:::caution Use the Golioth Firmware SDK for all Zephyr projects

This section documents the deprecated "Golioth Zephyr SDK". All support for
Zephyr RTOS has been moved to the [Golioth Firmware
SDK](https://github.com/golioth/golioth-firmware-sdk). Please use that for all
new projects and follow the Migration Guide to update existing projects. There
will be no further support or updates to this repository after July 31, 2024.

  (includes Zephyr support)

:::

The [Golioth Zephyr Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://github.com/golioth/golioth-zephyr-sdk) makes it easy to use [Golioth](https://golioth.io/) device management features with the [Zephyr real-time operating system (RTOS)](https://zephyrproject.org/). Like the Zephyr project itself, the Golioth Zephyr SDK is open source, and delivers the tools you need as a firmware engineer to communicate with and control microcontroller-based hardware over a network connection.
