title: Golioth Zephyr SDK
---

The [Golioth Zephyr Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://github.com/golioth/golioth-zephyr-sdk) makes it easy to use [Golioth](https://golioth.io/) device management features with the [Zephyr real-time operating system (RTOS)](https://zephyrproject.org/). Like the Zephyr project itself, the Golioth Zephyr SDK is open source, and delivers the tools you need as a firmware engineer to communicate with and control microcontroller-based hardware over a network connection.
