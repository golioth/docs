When a new release candidate appears on the Golioth Cloud it will be detected by any target boards not already running the new version and the DFU process will be started in Zephyr. Here is an example of what is visible on the serial console:

```

```

At this point MCUboot swaps the first application slot (containing old firmware) with the second application slot (containing new firmware). After a few seconds (this timing depends on firmware size) new firmware will be booted from the first application slot and the following messages will appear on the serial console:

```
*** Booting Zephyr OS build zephyr-v2.5.0-2205-g3276779c5a88  ***
[00:00:00.008,850] <dbg> golioth_dfu.main: Start DFU sample

[00:00:00.009,307] <inf> golioth_dfu: Starting connect

```

The application creates a shell command accessible via the serial console.  Execute the command `mcuboot` to confirm that new firmware is running from primary area (first application slot):

```
uart:~$ mcuboot
