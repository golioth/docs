## Introduction

Golioth is a cloud services platform for IoT devices. One accepted model for understanding services like those provided by golioth is the [Client Server Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model). Applying Client/Server to the IoT stretches the definition a bit but will prove useful for introducing our Device SDK.

<ComingSoon/>

The code contained within the DSDK plays the client role in that it is the initaior of communications to a Golioth server. The point is, Whether you have one device or many they can use the DSDK to connect a central Golioth "server" which assists the device and *you* with day to day functions.

Our DSDK currently abstracts the following services:

* Authentication
* Firmware Updates
* telemetry reporting via LightDB
* Bulk data streaming via LightDB Stream
* System Logging

The following sections will provide overviews and detailed guides on how to consume these services from an embedded, or firmware, development context.
