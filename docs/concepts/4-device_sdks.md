## Overview

This is the Device SDKs page. The details around individual device services Goioth offers are in the [Platform](/cloud/services/) section of the docs.

## Terminology

Here are some of the terms will we be using in Device Services section of the documentation:

* **Device SDK** - A "Software Development Kit" or "SDK" is a range of software drivers and examples offered to a user to quickly start building. An example Device SDK is the Golioth offering, built on top of the Zephyr SDK.
* **Firmware** - Code that is compiled for a particular piece of hardware and loaded onto said hardware
* **Hardware** - A piece of electronics, in this context with a programmable element like a microcontroller

## SDKs
Do you want to use Golioth with your new product? Start with our SDK!
For selected real-time operating systems (currently only Zephyr OS), we provide a pre-integrated higher level abstraction of our interfaces in the form of an SDK.

## Libraries
Do you have an existing product you want to use with Golioth? Or do you want a more granular control over software stack / footprint / resources? Our plug-and-play libraries are the fastest option. You can choose from the CoAP or MQTT flavors. Both are available in the C programming language, with community supported alternatives for other languages.
