### Release Manifest Format

Here is an example of a release manifest in JSON format:

```
{
  "sequenceNumber":1631741642,
  "hash":"25e73431ac4a1a09392d51c8af14b611defdd877e8021803af4414ad470ad6fb",
  "components":[
    {
      "package":"main",
      "version":"1.0.0",
      "hash":"feb982c3fbec352441caddaa85bd5c69ef5feadb5dfc1f57171e88e070771241",
      "size":538208,
      "uri":"/.u/c/main@1.0.0",
      "type": "mcuboot"
    }
  ]
}
```

When data is CBOR encoded, the keys are sent as numbers to reduce the size of the message.

### Firmware/Artifact State Reporting parameters and attributes

These are the query/body parameters that can be sent when reporting a given firmware/artifact state. When the device reports states for it's components, we will use these parameters to determine the current state of the device in regards to DFU and also save the historical information on our Device Logs feature, so you can query information for your fleet of device. Data is saved on the `golioth_dfu` module.

| Attribute          | Description                                                                     | Default         |

| `state` or `s`     | Firmware/Artifact State [See Valid Firmware States](#firmware-states)           | 0 - Idle        |
| `reason` or `r`    | Reason for Firmware/Artifact Report [See Valid Reason](#firmware-report-reason) | 0 - ready state |
| `package` or `pkg` | Firmware/Artifact package name                                                  | main            |
| `version` or `v`   | Running firmware/artifact version                                               |                 |
