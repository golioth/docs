title: Protocols Overview

One of the core principles for Golioth is to serve as the infrastructure for your IoT deployments. For that purpose, we want devices to access our services regardless of the protocol, but still using the best part of each one.

#### Protocol Usage

Our Protocol Gateways are documented for each device service available and inside of it you can see the definitions on how to use it on different protocols. A important aspect is how device will authenticate, that can be check on the [Device Authentication Guide](/reference/protocols/device-auth)

- CoAP Gateway
  - [Authentication](/reference/protocols/coap/auth)
  - [LightDB](/reference/protocols/coap/lightdb)
  - [LightDB Stream](/reference/protocols/coap/lightdb-stream)
  - [Device Firmware Update - DFU](/reference/protocols/coap/ota)
  - [Device Logs](/reference/protocols/coap/logging)
