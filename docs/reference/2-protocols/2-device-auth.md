title: Device Authentication
---

To access Golioth Services from a device, the device needs to be properly created and provisioned.

You can manage device level and project credentials using the Web Console or through the Golioth CLI.

## CoAP Gateway address and port

Devices can connect to the Golioth CoAP Gateway at the following endpoint:

 - `coap.golioth.io` at UDP port `5684`, using DTLS

Devices that use URL can connect using `coaps://coap.golioth.io/`.

The CoAP gateway requires authentication.

## Authentication Methods

| Authentication Method         | Description                             |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| DTLS PSK                      | Per-device pre-shared key               |
| DTLS Client Certificate       | Mutual certificate-based authentication |

## Pre-Shared Key (PSK) Authentication

For every device, a shared secret (key) needs to be established prior to first communication.

This can be as simple as generating a pre-shared key on the Golioth console, and loading it on your device. Alternatively, you can generate a key on the device, and upload it to Golioth.

See the getting started guide:

* Golioth Console: [authorize PSK
  devices](/getting-started/console/manage-devices).
* Command line Tools: [authorize PSK devices](/reference/command-line-tools/tutorial/authorize-devices).


## Client Certificate Authentication

Certificate authentication is more complex to setup and use than PSK authentication, but it provides a superior level of security. It also enables you to perform zero-touch provisioning of devices.

The trusted root or intermediate certificates are first configured on your Golioth project. When a device connects to Golioth using a certificate signed by one of your trusted certificates, the device will be *automatically provisioned* in that project.

### Server authentication

Your device can validate it is connecting to an authentic Golioth CoAP gateway by verifying the server certificate authenticity and validity.

That typically consists of multiple steps:
* Verify that the certificate by the gateway is signed by a trusted authority
* Verify the *Valid From* and *Valid Until* timestamps of the certificate
* Verify the Common Name (CN) of the certificate against the URL you are connecting to
* Verify the Alternative Subject Name (ASN) of the certificate against the URL you are connecting to

To verify the server certificate is signed by a trusted authority, your device will need to be pre-provisioned with a set of trusted authority certificates, and need to maintain them over its lifetime.

To verify the *Valid From* and *Valid Until* timestamps, your device will need to have an accurate real-time clock.

### Client Authentication

Before you can use client authentication, you will need to upload one or more trusted root or intermediate certificates to your Golioth project.

To successfully authenticate a device, your device will need to present a certificate signed by one of the root or intermediate certificates.

The device's client certificate will need to have the following values configured properly:

* Subject Organization (O) needs to match your Project ID (project slug).
* Subject Common Name (CN) needs to be a unique string identifying the device, and will be used as a Primary Device ID

If the prerequisites above are met, your device will be automatically provisioned upon first connection to Golioth, and will be allowed to connect.
