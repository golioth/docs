You can use Real-Time API for listening to real-time data from some services available on the platform, like LightDB, LightDB Stream, Logging and others services to be build in the future.

For this, you will use the WebSocket Protocol which will establishes a persistent communication between your application and Golioth Platform.

To establish the websocket connection you can use Graphical tools like [Postman](https://blog.postman.com/postman-supports-websocket-apis/), command line tools like [websocat](https://github.com/vi/websocat) or create your own websocket client in different languages like Python, Golang, etc to integrate within your application.

#### Real-Time API Usage

Real-Time API is documented using OpenAPI definitions. You can access the [API Reference Page](/reference/rest-api/openapi) to check all real-time endpoints that can be used. An important aspect is authentication, that can be check on the [Authentication Guide](./auth)
