:::caution
You must first follow the [Golioth Platform Quickstart](/getting-started) before attempting this guide.
:::

This walk-through will demonstrate how to use virtual devices to communicate with Golioth. We first will demonstrate using the `coap` command line tool to simulate commands coming from a hardware device and then move on to running Zephyr code natively on a host PC using [Native Simulator](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/boards/native/native_sim/doc/index.html).
