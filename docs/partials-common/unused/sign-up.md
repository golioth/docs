If it’s your first time using Golioth, you’ll need to sign up for an account. To do so, run

```
goliothctl login
```

This will take you to the sign-up page where you can either:

* Sign-up with email: Enter your email and password.
* Sign-up with Google: If you have a Google account, you can use that to sign up.

Whichever method you select you will be signed-up, signed-in and returned to your command line, ready to get started.
